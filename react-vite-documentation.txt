Learning react again from scratch. Making a note
From a Youtubre video :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqcY0GlETPk

Using linux.
Went to the linx root file directory and creating react-app. ( in root directory cuz its faser and solves the hot-reloading issue.)
Using 'vite' cus its faster. vite is a new frontend build tool for react
Commands:
npm create vite@4.1.0(for the 4 version)
chose framworke React and vaiant typeScript
cd react-app
npm i (for installing all libraries)
npm run dev -to start the react app and its gonna host locally

extentsion for typeScript files should be .ts or .tsx. tsx for react component. example: Message.tsx

made a new component named Message.tsx. deleted everything from App.tsx. Used JSX and used our new component there.

Going to use bootstrap for css in this learning react app
command to install bootstrap:
 npm i bootstrap@5.2.3

Deleted everything from App.css and index.css since we dont need veet generated css
going to use bootstrap. So, opened main.tsx and instead of importing index.css, i did--> import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css'
now our content is on top left well formated.Z

Always ise <> for multiple JSX
